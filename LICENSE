 * Brief: 
 *
 *    This Android application is the part of the author's thesis, MS of
 * computer science in 2015. The main purpose is easy and straightforward:
 * to develop an Android application based on OpenCV so that it has the
 * features of face detection and face recognition. OpenCV has supported
 * three face recognition algorithms, this software does not develop new
 * algorithms. However, it really does some careful design and analysis 
 * to make the face recognition easy and friendly to use: just take pictures
 * with your friends and yourself, and hope you have fun from it.
