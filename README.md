# Whoo
An Android recognition application based on OpenCV
## Brief
  The Android application Whoo is the part of the author's thesis, MS of
computer science in 2015. The main purpose is easy and straightforward:
to develop an Android application based on OpenCV so that it has the
features of face detection and face recognition. OpenCV has supported
three face recognition algorithms and this software does not develop new
algorithms. However, it really did some careful design and optimizations
to make the face recognition easy and friendly to use. Just take pictures
to your friends and yourself, and hope you have fun from it.
